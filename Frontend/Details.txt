here we have learn that we have to divide application in 5 folders in which 3 are of redux and other are normal like components and images

1. Actions: here all api is calling

2. Components:here our app divided into parts
	2.1: ADMIN: all operation related to admin can full fill here
	2.2: CART: all operation related to cart can full fill here
	2.3: HOME: all operation related to home can full fill here
	2.4: LAYOUT: all layout styles and operation can perform here
	2.5: ORDER: all operation related to order can full fill here
	2.6: PRODUCT: all operation related to product can full fill here
	2.7: ROUTE: all operation related to authenticated routes can full fill here

3. Constants: here we have to declare all variable which we are use in reducers as well as actions

4. Images: all images of frontend

5. Reducers: here we can tell our system on which button or file we can send which type of data 

some files are 
1. app.css
2. app.js
3. index.js
4. store.js
